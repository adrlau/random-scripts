# random-scripts
A tiny collection of small but kinda useful scripts i like to have and keep around.

claunch - a script that compiles and runs c++ or c code 
while-curl - a script to curl a url with set amount and time intervals. 
strun - can run strings (or files) given language. (depends on claunch for c/cpp files)

more possibly coming as i add stuff to this repo (not a promise)
